	Wikipedia's description for Hardening:

    In computing, hardening is usually the process of securing a system
    by reducing its surface of vulnerability.
    A system has a larger vulnerability surface the more functions
    it fulfills; in principle a single-function system is more secure
    than a multipurpose one.
    Reducing available vectors of attack typically includes the
    removal of unnecessary software, unnecessary usernames or
    logins and the disabling or removal of unnecessary services.[1]
